### What I learned

I gained valuable experience in translating a professional design into code. Specifically, I learned how to:

- Accurately measure and apply spacing, padding, and font styles directly from the Figma design file.

- Utilize the design system elements (like specified colors and typography) to maintain pixel-perfect fidelity and ensure the component was built to spec.

### Continued development

- Improving accessiblity using ARIA attributes
- Learning more about different image formets and optimization (e.g., using the \<picture> element for responsive images)
