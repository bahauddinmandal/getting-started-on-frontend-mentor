- Structuring the content using appropriate **semantic HTML** to ensure accessibility and maintainability.

## ðŸš€ What I Learned

During this challenge, I gained valuable practice and deeper understanding in two key areas:

- **Styling Lists:** I learned advanced techniques for styling the **`<ul>`** and **`<li>`** tags, including removing default styles and using custom methods (like pseudo-elements) to create the visually distinct list markers seen on the page.
- **CSS Media Queries:** I utilized **media queries** to ensure the design was fully **responsive** and looked excellent on various screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.
