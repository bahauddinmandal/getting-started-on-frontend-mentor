## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge served as a quick, focused exercise in translating a static design (JPEGs) into a fully functional and styled component, reinforcing the ability to pay close attention to details like font weights, colors, and spacing.

### Continued development

While this challenge is complete, here are the areas I would focus on for further practice and improvement in future projects:

1.  **Accessibility (a11y) Refinements:** I would dedicate more time to ensuring **optimal keyboard navigation** and comprehensive **ARIA attributes** are used, especially for interactive elements like the social links, to guarantee a better experience for screen reader users.

2.  **CSS Variables for Theming:** For a slightly larger project, I would implement **CSS Custom Properties (Variables)** to define colors, fonts, and potentially spacing. This would make it trivial to create a light/dark theme toggle or update the overall style guide rapidly.

3.  **Responsive Text Scaling:** I'd explore more advanced responsive techniques like using **`clamp()`** for font sizes. This would allow the typography to scale more smoothly between different viewport sizes than just using fixed pixel or rem values within media queries.

4.  **BEM Naming Convention:** Although this project is small, I would formally adopt a methodology like the **Block-Element-Modifier (BEM) naming convention** to structure the CSS class names. This improves clarity, modularity, and scalability, making it easier to manage styles as a project grows.
